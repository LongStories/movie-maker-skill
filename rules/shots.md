## Shot rules (promptable cinematography)

### Use a small fixed shot vocabulary
Pick from:
- **WS** (wide shot)
- **MS** (medium shot)
- **CU** (close-up)
- **ECU** (extreme close-up)
- **OTS** (over-the-shoulder)
- **POV**
- **Insert** (object detail)

### Default shot plan for short movies
If unsure, use:
1) WS establish
2) OTS on work/action
3) CU emotion/detail
4) Insert (object/screen)
5) MS resolve

### Prompt composition essentials
Every image prompt should include:
- subject
- action/emotion
- setting
- lighting
- lens/texture cue (e.g. 35mm grain)
- aspect ratio

Example skeleton:

```
Cinematic OTS of [SUBJECT], [ACTION], [SETTING], [LIGHTING], 35mm film grain, rich contrast, 16:9
```

### Motion prompts (image-to-video)
Keep motion subtle and physically plausible:
- slow push-in
- slight handheld drift
- rain streaks moving
- screen flicker
- breath/shoulder shift

Avoid:
- teleport cuts
- impossible camera moves
- rapid character morphing
