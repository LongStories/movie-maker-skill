## Style presets (copy/paste)

Use these as **global style strings** and keep them stable across all shots.

### Cinematic / live-action (default)
"cinematic, naturalistic lighting, 35mm film grain, rich contrast, shallow depth of field"

### 3D animated (family / feature animation)
"stylized 3D animation, soft global illumination, clean surfaces, warm color palette, expressive faces, high-quality render"

### Anime
"anime style, clean linework, cel shading, dramatic lighting, cinematic framing, detailed backgrounds"

### 2D illustration
"2D illustration, textured brush strokes, flat shading, strong silhouettes, poster-like composition"

### Photoreal
"photoreal, natural skin texture, realistic lighting, high dynamic range, sharp details"

### Rule
Pick **one** style preset per movie and don’t mix.
