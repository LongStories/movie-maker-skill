## Video prompting rules

### Motion should be subtle
Good motions:
- slow push-in / push-out
- gentle handheld drift
- rain streaks moving
- screen flicker
- breathing / small posture shifts

Avoid:
- rapid camera spins
- big character transformations
- "cinematic action" vagueness

### Tie motion to the scene’s intention
- If the scene is tense: hold longer, minimal motion.
- If the scene is progress: slightly quicker cuts, purposeful movement.

### Prompt template

```
{CAMERA_MOVE}. {ENV_MOTION}. {SUBJECT_MICRO_ACTION}. Naturalistic, grounded realism.
```

Example:
"Locked OTS with a slow push-in. Rain trails down the window. The cursor blinks; hands hover over the keyboard."
